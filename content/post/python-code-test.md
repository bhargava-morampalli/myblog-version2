## Which programming language to learn as a beginner?

I started learning python seriously about a couple months ago which I found a very good starter programming language. I also did research on which languages many scientists in the field - either bioinformatics or data science are using. Following this, I also researched online on several job portals and found python almost in every job posting which involves data science and bioinformatics. Other language that I found is being used a lot by the community is "R". But, that discussion is for another time.

Ultimately, I find this method of deciding which language to pursue is more practical and python definitely fits the bill as  the language of choice to several.

1. The syntax is easily readable and more importantly direct so that it's easier to understand.
2. Things to learn in python are vast and again here, I found the most practical way to learn more is by applying what you learn on real projects rather than just reading through documentation.
3. But, don't get me wrong. Before you start working on projects to improve your skills, you definitely need to learn some basics first.
4. Following this, you are ready to apply your beginner skills on projects and learn more advanced skills of python.




```python
import pandas as pd
print("hello world")
file = open("file.csv")
file.read()
print("file.read()")
file.close()
```
