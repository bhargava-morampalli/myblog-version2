## About me

Hello! I am Bhargava and I am a first year PhD student at [Massey University](www.massey.ac.nz) in [Silander Lab](https://silanderlab.com). My project involves studying microbial evolution using *Escherichia coli* as model organism. I will be trying to use both natural isolates (bacteria isolated from environment - evolution by natural selection) and also, experimental/laboratory evolution.

## Background

I have a Bachelor's degree in Pharmacy from [JSS College of Pharmacy](https://www.jssuni.edu.in/JSSWeb/WebShowFromDB.aspx?MID=0&CID=3&PID=10002#), Mysore (India) and a Master's degree in Pharmacology from [Northeastern University](http://www.northeastern.edu/), Boston (USA). During and after my Master's degree, I worked in different labs.
1. [Khademhosseini Lab](https://tissueeng.net/) at [Harvard-MIT division of Health Sciences](https://hst.mit.edu/) who is now at [UCLA](http://www.ucla.edu/)
1. [Rajagopal Lab](https://www.rajagopallab.com/) where I worked with [Dr. Purushothama Rao Tata](https://thetatalab.com/) who is now at [Duke University](https://www.duke.edu/).
1. [Chan Lab](https://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/Profiles/display/Person/73094) at Boston Children's Hospital
1. Foundational Neuroscience Centre at [AbbVie Pharmaceuticals](https://www.abbvie.com/our-science/therapeutic-focus-areas/neuroscience.html)

Through these experiences, I am well-versed in several molecular biology techniques. I strongly believe basic sciences research will lead to deeper understanding of our natural world and the discoveries thereof will lead to betterment of human life.

I am also extremely fascinated by data explosion in the fields of basic sciences research and healthcare which I believe will lead to revolutionary discoveries either from analysis themselves or by helping design better experiments in wet lab.
