## About me

Hi there! I am Bhargava Reddy Morampalli!

I am an experienced molecular biologist with over 4 years' experience in working on different projects related to regeneration, cancer, neuroscience, endocrinology (delayed puberty) as well as limited experience in bioinformatics and microfluidics. My research and work interests are applying my knowledge and skillset for finding answers to questions in basic sciences which inturn will lead to development of new therapies for currently incurable diseases.

I am also extremely fascinated by data explosion in the fields of basic sciences research and healthcare which I believe will lead to revolutionary discoveries either from analysis themselves or by helping design better experiments in wet lab. That's why I am currently teaching myself programming and data analysis tools so that I can grow as a scientist who can understand and utilize information from both wet and dry lab techniques.

This blog is especially to write about my journey into this new field and I might also write some posts related to topics in biology. Please don't hesitate to contact me regarding anything at all.
